# Project: Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

## Introduction: 
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. The task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Key Project Questions
* The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
* They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money.
* Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
* Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
*  The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.

## Data set
This project was fabricated by CareerFoundry, using a number of open-source data sets from Instacart. I received 4 different data sets that were combined to answer the project's demands. The population flow can be checked below.
